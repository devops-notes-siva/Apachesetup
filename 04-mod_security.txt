How to Block a URL Using a Custom Rule in mod_security on a RHEL Apache HTTPD Server
    $ sudo yum install mod_security -y
Check if mod_security is loaded by running:
    httpd -M | grep security
        security2_module (shared)

Step 2: Configure mod_security to Block the Specific URL
    2.1 Create or Edit a Custom Rule in mod_security

    Locate mod_security Configuration Directory:

        On RHEL, mod_security configuration is usually located in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ or /etc/httpd/conf/. The default file to add rules is mod_security.conf.

        Open mod_security Configuration File:

        If it doesn't exist, you can create a custom file in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ (e.g., mod_security_custom_rules.conf)

        You will write a custom rule to block the URL https://harder-dev1.it.hpe.com/_vti_inf.html
        sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/mod_security_custom_rules.conf
            SecRule REQUEST_URI "@streq /_vti_inf.html" \
             "id:10001,phase:1,deny,status:403,msg:'Blocking _vti_inf.html URL'"
        
    Explanation of the Rule:

    SecRule REQUEST_URI "@streq /_vti_inf.html": This checks if the requested URI is exactly / _vti_inf.html. The @streq operator means "string equal."
    id:10001: Each SecRule needs a unique rule ID. This ID is used for logging and referencing.
    phase:1: This specifies that the rule should be applied during the request phase, meaning before the server processes the request or sends any response.
    deny: This action will deny the request if the rule matches.
    status:403: If the request is denied, the server will respond with an HTTP 403 Forbidden status.
    msg:'Blocking _vti_inf.html URL': This is a custom message for logging purposes.

        Save and Exit: After adding the rule, save and exit the file.
