1) Checking for "rewrite_module" is enabled or not:
==============================================
Execute the following command to list all loaded modules:
    sudo httpd -M | grep rewrite
if mod_rewrite is enabled, you should see an output like this:
    rewrite_module (shared)

The main Apache configuration file is usually located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf. You might also have 
    LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

2) Applying condotion:
    Method 1: Using mod_rewrite (Recommended)
    vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/_vti_inf\.html$ [NC]
        RewriteRule .* - [F,L]
        </IfModule>

    Method 2: Using mod_alias (Simpler)
    vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
        RedirectMatch 403 /_vti_inf\.html
    
    Method 3: Using FilesMatch (Strictly Blocking the File)
    vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

        <FilesMatch "^_vti_inf\.html$">
        Require all denied
        </FilesMatch>

3) sudo systemctl restart httpd
4)Verification
    curl -I https://your-domain.com/_vti_inf.html

    to bypass procy temp:
         curl -I https://harder-dev1.it.hpe.com/_vti_inf.html --noproxy '*'
5) Check if the request is reaching Apache
    sudo netstat -tulnp | grep ':80\|:443'

-----------------------

Even afetr applying if you are still getting response, there are a few potential reasons for this:

Proxy Interference (Zscaler)

    1) Your connection is going through a Zscaler proxy, which may be caching the response or bypassing your local Apache server.
    To check if the request is actually reaching your server, try accessing the file directly from the RHEL machine:
        curl -I http://localhost/_vti_inf.html

            Clear Zscaler Cache Manually (Admin Required)
            Disable Zscaler Caching for This File -->to the Cache Exclusions list.
            Apache Headers to Prevent Caching
                    <FilesMatch "^_vti_inf\.html$">
                    Header set Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0"
                     Header set Pragma "no-cache"
                    Header set Expires 0
                    </FilesMatch>

    2) Virtual Host Configuration
        httpd -S

        Single-Host Configuration (Default Mode)
        Virtual Host Configuration (For Multiple Websites on One Server)




Checking openssl connection:
================================
 openssl s_client -connect harder-dev1.it.hpe.com:443 | grep -i 'cipher's

 Test Individual Ciphers
    openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 -cipher ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
 
 to check postconf 
    The smtpd_client_new_tls_session_rate_limit setting in Postfix controls the number of new TLS sessions a client is allowed to initiate within a specified time frame. It is a rate-limiting feature to prevent abuse and ensure that a single client doesn't overwhelm the mail server with too many TLS handshakes in a short period.
        $ postconf smtpd_client_new_tls_session_rate_limit
    to set no number:
        postconf -e 'smtpd_client_new_tls_session_rate_limit = 10'
